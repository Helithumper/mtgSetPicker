# MTG Set Picker

This is a simple set picker tool for magic the gathering.

## Objective

I have a list of cards I'd like to get. I could buy singles,
but that's no fun. I'd rather buy packs and find what I can.

The same card can be in multiple sets. I don't care which
version of a card I get, only that I have the card.

So:
What set contains the largest number of cards that I'm
looking for?

## Bonus Features

1. Cache data from scryfall so I don't overwhelp their API.
1. Rate-limit scryfall calls because they asked nicely (https://scryfall.com/docs/api#rate-limits-and-good-citizenship).
